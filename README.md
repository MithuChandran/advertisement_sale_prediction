## Introduction

In this project, we use logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict advertisement sales. The model is trained on existing customer data, which includes various features such as age, gender, income, and browsing history. By analyzing these features, the model can identify potential customers who are likely to make a purchase.
